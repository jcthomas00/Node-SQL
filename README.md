# Jacob's Bamazon Mega Store
###What is Bamazon?
I'm planning on building an Amazon-killer by creating a CLI JavaScript application that is run in node and connects to a mySQL (that every user needs to install on their localhost).
###How to run it?
1.Run the bamazon-schema.sql and bamazon-data.sql scripts through your mySQL workbench
2.Run `npm install` in command line to install dependencies
3.Run `node bamazonCustomer.js` in your command line to run the program
	-Enter one of the listed item's id
	-Enter the quantity of the item you'd like to see your total
